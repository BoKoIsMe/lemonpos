Due to an importan update to database, migration/update database scripts
are not provided. Create a new database to use 0.9 "real" release.

If you want to preserve your old data, you can edit the lemon_mysql.sql and 
replace all occurences of 'lemondb' with a new name;  you will
get a backup database with the name lemondb, and a new one with a new name.
This would make lemon -and squeeze- unable to connect to database,
but  you can change the configuration for database and type the new
database name.

Lemon is an opensource point of sale for linux, and other unix. 
It is a general POS, not targeted to a specific business.

It has been developed for ease of use and customization, and to support
barcode scanners and ticket printers. At this point, it has been tested
with a parallel port ticket printer (Star Micronics, SP500) and a barcode 
reader (datalogic DLC6065-M0).
